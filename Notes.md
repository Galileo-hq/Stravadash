Documentation Summary:

The Docs folder provides a comprehensive plan for the Strava Dashboard project:

* Setup & Authentication (STRAVA_API_SETUP.md, strava_api_research.md): Details how users need to create a Strava App, get credentials, set up .env.local, and outlines the OAuth flow, required scopes (activity:read_all), key API endpoints (/athlete/activities), available metrics, and rate limits.
* Deployment (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md, DOMAIN_SETTINGS_GUIDE.md): Recommends Vercel via GitHub integration, details environment variable setup on Vercel, custom domain configuration, security headers (vercel.json), performance optimizations, and the critical step of updating the Strava callback URL. Cloudflare and self-hosting are mentioned as alternatives. pnpm is consistently mentioned as the package manager for build/run commands.
* Testing & Verification (TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md, VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md): Outlines local testing via a /test page (using api-connection-test.tsx and data-verification.tsx) and extensive post-deployment verification steps covering functionality, data accuracy, performance, and security.
* Usage (ACCESS_GUIDE.md): Explains how users access the deployed app, log in, share (understanding that shared links show the viewer's data), and potential embedding options, along with privacy considerations.
* Design (architecture.md, wireframes.md): Defines the Next.js/Recharts/Tailwind stack, component breakdown, data flow (including caching), and provides UI mockups for the main dashboard, selectors, settings, and activity details.
* Roadmap (todo.md): Tracks progress, confirming that while setup, auth, and basic UI components are likely done, core data fetching, transformation, and caching remain incomplete. Planned future enhancements include weather/terrain analysis and goal tracking.

I will save this information to memory.

Next Steps:

Based on both the code structure and the detailed documentation (especially the confirmation of pnpm usage and the outstanding tasks in todo.md), the immediate next steps are:

* Install Dependencies: Run pnpm install to install the packages defined in the package.json I created.
* Implement Data Fetching: Start building out the logic in strava-client.ts or strava-hooks.tsx to call the GET /athlete/activities Strava API endpoint, handle pagination, and retrieve the necessary activity data based on user selections.
* Implement Data Transformation: Flesh out data-transformers.ts to convert units (meters to miles, m/s to min/mile) and aggregate data (e.g., weekly summaries) as required by the charts and planned summary statistics.
