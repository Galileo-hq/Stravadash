# Verifying Your Deployed Strava Dashboard

This guide provides steps to verify that your Strava dashboard has been successfully deployed and is functioning correctly.

## Initial Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Select your Strava dashboard project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Verify that the latest deployment shows "Complete" status with a green checkmark
5. Check for any build errors or warnings in the deployment logs

### 2. Access Your Dashboard

1. Visit your dashboard URL (either the Vercel-provided URL or your custom domain)
2. Verify that the page loads without errors
3. Check that the styling and layout appear as expected on both desktop and mobile devices

## Authentication Testing

### 1. Test Strava Authentication

1. Click the "Login with Strava" button on your dashboard
2. You should be redirected to Strava's authorization page
3. Authorize the application
4. You should be redirected back to your dashboard
5. Verify that you are successfully logged in

### 2. Check Authorization Scopes

1. After logging in, check that your dashboard has access to the required Strava data
2. Verify that you can see your profile information
3. Ensure that activity data is accessible

## Data Verification

### 1. Check Activity Data

1. Navigate to the dashboard main view
2. Verify that your running activities are displayed
3. Check that the metrics (distance, pace, heart rate, etc.) are showing correctly
4. Confirm that the data matches what you see in your Strava account

### 2. Test Time Period Selection

1. Try selecting different time periods (week, month, three months, year, etc.)
2. Verify that the data updates accordingly
3. Check that historical data is displayed correctly

### 3. Verify Metric Selection

1. Test switching between different metrics (distance, pace, heart rate, elevation, cadence, power)
2. Confirm that the charts update to show the selected metric
3. Verify that the units and scales are appropriate for each metric

## Performance Testing

### 1. Check Loading Speed

1. Use Chrome DevTools (F12) to check the page load time
2. Verify that the initial page load is reasonably fast (under 3 seconds)
3. Check that data loading and chart rendering is efficient

### 2. Test Responsiveness

1. Test the dashboard on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
2. Verify that the layout adapts appropriately to different screen sizes
3. Check that all features are usable on mobile devices

## Security Verification

### 1. Check HTTPS

1. Verify that your site is served over HTTPS
2. Check that the SSL certificate is valid (no browser warnings)

### 2. Verify Authentication Security

1. Test that unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes
2. Verify that authentication tokens are stored securely
3. Check that the session expires appropriately

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Connection Problems

If your dashboard cannot connect to the Strava API:

1. Check that your environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
2. Verify that your Strava API credentials are valid
3. Ensure that your callback URL is correctly configured in your Strava API settings

### Data Display Issues

If data is not displaying correctly:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that your data transformation functions are working correctly
3. Ensure that the date formats and time zones are handled properly

### Authentication Failures

If users cannot log in:

1. Verify that the Strava OAuth flow is correctly implemented
2. Check that your redirect URIs are properly configured
3. Ensure that your NextAuth secret is set correctly

## Getting Support

If you encounter issues that you cannot resolve:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Review the Strava API documentation for any API-related issues
3. Consult the Next.js and React Query documentation for framework-specific problems
